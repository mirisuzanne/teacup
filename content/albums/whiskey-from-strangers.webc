    A pond with cattail reeds and mountains,

    with an electrical diagram sun reflecting in the water -
    small red arrows form rays pointing in at the sun.

summary: |
  For our second album,
  we revisit some of our oldest material --
  a unified piece
  of storytelling and music in four movements.
  This is a modern Denver mythology,
  based on the Greek stories
  of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis.
