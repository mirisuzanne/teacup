    Album cover:
    A pond with cattail reeds and mountains,
    sketched in a single pencil line,
    with an electrical diagram sun reflecting in the water -
    small red arrows form rays pointing in at the sun.
    The four songs are listed on the back,
    along with credits and copyright.
summary: |
  For our second album,
  we revisit (and re-imagine)
  some of our oldest material --
  the soundtrack and storytelling
  that inspired our recent live show
  with Grapefruit Lab.
  This is a modern Denver mythology
  in four parts,
  based on the Greek stories
  of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis.
