      Reminiscent of late â€˜90s punk
      with elements of spoken word combed through,
      Teacup Gorilla never fails to put the moodiness
      to their heavy indie-rock.

      Teacup Gorilla's amiable creative approach,
      unorthodox roots, and sense of community
      have resulted in a sound that is difficult to pin down --
      part instrumental rock, part glam, part psychedelic, part jazz-inflected.
      And it sounds like nothing much else in this highly imitative era.

summary: |
  **Teacup Gorilla** inhabits the venues of Denver, CO
  with dark indie-rock soundscapes and evocative poetry --
  sometimes complex, dissonant,
  or introspective,
  but always pushing towards moments of
  unexpected harmony and celebration.

Often compared to early
Modest Mouse, Low,
or Velvet Underground --
Teacup Gorilla formed to create and underscore
the **Missa Populi** theater production in 2010.
Since then we've underscored
many shows with different theater companies around Denver,
and released several EPs
and a full length soundtrack.

- 2015, [_The Holes They Leave_][thtl] (EP) --
  along side the multimedia novel
  [_Riding SideSaddle\*_](http://ridingsidesaddle.com).
- 2024, [_Whiskey From Strangers_][whiskey] (EP) --
  adapted into [a full-length play](/theater/whiskey/).
- 2025, [_Jane/Eyre: No Net Ensnares Me_] --
  in collaboration with Dameon Merkl,
  along side the [Grapefruit Lab production](/theater/janeeyre/).
