summary: |
  **Teacup Gorilla** inhabits the venues of Denver, CO
  with dark indie-rock soundscapes and evocative poetry --
  sometimes complex, dissonant,
  or introspective,
  but always pushing towards moments of
  unexpected harmony and celebration.
---

Often compared to early
Modest Mouse, Low,
or Velvet Underground --
Teacup Gorilla formed to create and underscore
the **Missa Populi** theater production in 2010,
and released a debut EP --
([The Holes They Leave][thtl]) --
in the summer of 2015,
along with the multimedia novel
[Riding SideSaddle\*](http://ridingsidesaddle.com).
Their second EP --
_Whiskey From Strangers_ --
will be released
on **August 20, 2024**.
