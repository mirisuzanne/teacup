As an orphan living with her cruel aunt,
Jane is often afraid,
but this song portrays a rare moment of thrilling escape.
Jane has found a hiding place in which to read,
and a book to spirit her away to vast fields of icy northern ocean.
The moment is a tangled combination
of melancholy, isolation, excitement, and expanding possibility.
The song attempts to hold these opposing ideas together
with an upbeat sound and ice-filled lyrics.

This song acts as “Jane’s Theme” throughout the production,
representing Jane’s inner world.
Charlotte Brontë has been called the
“first historian of the private consciousness,”
and the Jane Eyre novel is one of the first to follow
the inner thoughts of a woman coming of age.
