Jane’s first true friend (and childhood crush?) Helen Burns helps her survive and thrive at Lowood boarding school. “An attachment as strong and tender as any that ever animated my heart,” Jane says, looking back on her life. Helen offers a young Jane the courage to hold space for her own goals and sense of self, even in the face of insults.

Helen’s theme starts both strong and tender, confident while gentle. But as typhoid sweeps through the school and Helen becomes ill, the song changes tone (and time signature) – leading into a mournful guitar solo with a background of glockenspiel. The song structure and Daniel’s solo are heavily inspired by Funkadelic’s Maggot Brain, and the emotional improvised solo by Eddie Hazel – one of our favorites.

Resurgam is a Latin word meaning “I shall rise again.”
