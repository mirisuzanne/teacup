  We’re teaming up with [Grapefruit Lab](https://grapefruitlab.com/)
  for an intimate 2-night house show
  to benefit our local

This is part of the [Fall of Freedom](https://www.falloffreedom.com/),
a creative resistance
as our government seems intent on
banning the practices we care about most.
The show will include music from
all three of our albums
and multiple Grapfruit Lab productions --
featuring special guests
Dameon Merkle, Julie Rada, and Lars Reid.

There's limited space,
so [reserve your tickets now](https://grapefruitlab.com/shows/banned-practice/)!
